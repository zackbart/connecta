## Sign in and grant team access

Before using tools that access your Vercel resources:

1. [Connect your AI client to Vercel MCP](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp#setup).
2. Complete the sign-in flow in your browser with the Vercel account you want to use.
3. Authorize your AI client and grant access to the teams you want it to work with.

Adding the server to your client does not complete authorization. Your assistant needs access to the team that owns a project before it can work with that project's deployments or logs. Your existing Vercel permissions still apply.

Ask your assistant to list your teams and projects to check its access. If a team is missing, check that you're signed in to the right account and have granted the connection access to that team.

## Frequently used tools

Start with these tools to find your resources, inspect deployments, and troubleshoot errors:

| Tool | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| [`list_deployments`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/deployments/list_deployments) | List deployments for a project. |
| [`get_deployment`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/deployments/get_deployment) | Inspect a deployment's status and details. |
| [`web_fetch_vercel_url`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/deployments/web_fetch_vercel_url) | Fetch content from a deployment URL, including protected deployments you can access. |
| [`get_runtime_logs`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/observability/get_runtime_logs) | Read and filter runtime logs for a project or deployment. |
| [`list_projects`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/projects/list_projects) | Find projects in a team. |
| [`list_teams`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/teams/list_teams) | Find the teams you can access. |
| [`get_project`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/projects/get_project) | Inspect a project's configuration and details. |
| [`get_runtime_errors`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/observability/get_runtime_errors) | Investigate grouped runtime errors and affected routes. |

For example, ask: "Find my project's latest deployment and check its runtime errors." Your assistant can use several tools to complete the request. Include the team and project name so it can find the right resources.
