## `buy_addon`

Purchase a Vercel add-on for a team, by integer quantity. Currently only the `siem` add-on ([SIEM log drains](/docs/drains)) is available, and the team must be on the Flex plan.

Vercel's API doesn't return a price for add-ons, so the quote includes a `priceNote` and a link to the team's billing settings where you can review the unit price before confirming.

**Sample prompt:** "Buy 2 units of the SIEM add-on for my team"

## `buy_credits`

Purchase prepaid credits for [v0](https://v0.dev), [AI Gateway](/docs/ai-gateway), or [Vercel Agent](/docs/agent). The amount is quoted directly, since credits cost exactly what you buy.

Some credit types have plan prerequisites: Vercel Agent credits require the team to be on [Vercel Pro](/docs/plans/pro-plan) (upgrade first with `buy_pro`), and v0 credits require a paid v0 plan. AI Gateway credits have no prerequisite. If a required plan is missing, the purchase is rejected with guidance and nothing is charged.

| Parameter        | Type    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `creditType`     | string  | Yes      | -       | Which credit balance to top up: `v0`, `gateway` (AI Gateway), or `agent` (Vercel Agent)                                                                                                      |
| `amount`         | number  | Yes      | -       | Amount to purchase, in whole US dollars (1–1000)                                                                                                                                             |
| `teamId`         | string  | Yes      | -       | The team ID to purchase credits for. Alternatively the team slug can be used. Team IDs start with 'team\_' and can be found by reading `.vercel/project.json` (orgId) or using `list_teams`. |
| `confirm`        | boolean | Yes      | -       | Set `true` to execute the charge                                                                                                                                                             |
| `idempotencyKey` | string  | Yes      | -       | The `idempotencyKey` returned by `get_purchase_quote`                                                                                                                                        |

**Sample prompt:** "Buy $25 of AI Gateway credits for my team"

## `buy_credits_endpoint`

To purchase credits, use [`get_purchase_quote`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/billing/get_purchase_quote) followed by [`buy_credits`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/billing/buy_credits). This tool does not execute purchases.

## `buy_domain`

Register (purchase) a single [domain](/docs/domains) for a team. The quote (`get_purchase_quote` with `product: domain`) checks availability and returns the live `purchasePrice` for the requested term. The **confirm** step must echo that price back as `expectedPrice`, and the order is rejected if the live price no longer matches, so you are never charged more than the amount you saw quoted.

Pass the registration term (`years`) from the quote and the full registrant (`contact`) details when confirming the purchase.

Domain registration completes asynchronously: a successful **confirm** step returns an `orderId` that you can use with [`get_domain_order`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/billing/get_domain_order) to check whether the registration completed.

| Parameter        | Type    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `expectedPrice`  | number  | Yes      | -       | The `purchasePrice` (USD) from the quote. The order is rejected if it no longer matches the live price                                                                                          |

| `teamId`         | string  | Yes      | -       | The team ID to register the domain for. Alternatively the team slug can be used. Team IDs start with 'team\_' and can be found by reading `.vercel/project.json` (orgId) or using `list_teams`. |
| `confirm`        | boolean | Yes      | -       | Set `true` to execute the purchase                                                                                                                                                              |

**Sample prompt:** "Buy the domain mydomain.com"

## `buy_pro`

Upgrade a team to a Vercel Pro subscription. This starts recurring Pro billing immediately at the standard Pro price. Vercel's API doesn't return the Pro subscription price, so the quote includes a `pricingUrl` pointing to [current Pro pricing](https://vercel.com/pricing) to review before confirming.

| Parameter        | Type    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teamId`         | string  | Yes      | -       | The team ID to upgrade. Alternatively the team slug can be used. Team IDs start with 'team\_' and can be found by reading `.vercel/project.json` (orgId) or using the `list_teams` tool. |
| `confirm`        | boolean | Yes      | -       | Set `true` to execute the upgrade                                                                                                                                                        |
| `idempotencyKey` | string  | Yes      | -       | The `idempotencyKey` returned by `get_purchase_quote`                                                                                                                                    |

**Sample prompt:** "Upgrade my team to Vercel Pro"

## `get_domain_order`

Get the status of a domain purchase order returned by `buy_domain`, to confirm whether the asynchronous registration completed. It is read-only action.

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                        |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `orderId` | string | Yes      | -       | The `orderId` returned by `buy_domain`                                             |
| `teamId`  | string | No       | -       | The team ID the domain was purchased for. Alternatively the team slug can be used. |

**Sample prompt:** "Did my domain purchase go through?"

## `get_purchase_quote`

Get a price quote for any purchase. This is a read-only action that never charges. It is the only source of an `idempotencyKey`, so it is the required first step before any `buy_*` tool usage. For products with no API price (add-ons, Pro), the quote includes a `priceNote` and a billing or pricing URL to review instead of a number.

You typically won't invoke this tool directly. Your AI client calls it automatically as the first step of any purchase and presents the quote for your approval.

| Parameter      | Type    | Required      | Default     | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `teamId`       | string  | Yes           | -           | The team ID the purchase is for. Alternatively, the team slug can be used. Team IDs start with 'team\_' and can be found by reading `.vercel/project.json` (orgId) or using `list_teams`. |

## How purchases work

Every purchase uses the same quote-then-confirm flow:

1. **Quote**: Call [`get_purchase_quote`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/billing/get_purchase_quote) with the product and its parameters. This tool is read-only and nothing is charged. The response includes the cost (when Vercel can quote one), the applicable spend limit, and an `idempotencyKey` that encodes the quoted terms. Quoting is required before the `buy_*` tools can be used.
2. **Review**: Review the quote and approve it. Charges are immediate and non-refundable.
3. **Confirm**: Call the matching `buy_*` tool with `confirm: true`, the same parameters, and the `idempotencyKey` from the quote. Quotes expire after 5 minutes: an expired or mismatched key is rejected and you must quote again.

The flow provides these guarantees:

- Submitting the same `idempotencyKey` twice does not create a second charge.
- The `idempotencyKey` is a signed token of the quoted terms. The server rejects a confirmation call whose parameters don't exactly match the quote.
- Purchases require a valid payment method on the team. If no payment method is on file, nothing is charged and the response includes a `billingUrl` where you can add one before retrying.
- Your MCP client may prompt you before executing a `confirm: true` call. Declining the prompt never triggers a charge.
- A successful confirmation returns a `billingUrl` (team billing settings, where the charge appears) and a `proofUrl` showing the purchase. Billing history may take a few minutes to update.

**Sample prompt:** "Show me a quote for upgrading my team to Pro."
